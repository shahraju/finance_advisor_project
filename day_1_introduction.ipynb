    "## 1. Introduction  \n",
    "Money management is one of the most common real-life challenges.  \n",
    "Most people track income and expenses but donâ€™t know if they are overspending, saving enough, or how their savings will look in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is my attempt to build a **mini personal finance advisor** using data science.  \n",
    "It will use spending and income data to:  \n",
    "- Analyze where money is going ðŸ’¸  \n",
    "- Predict savings for the next few months ðŸ“ˆ  \n",
    "- Detect overspending patterns ðŸš¨  \n",
    "- Provide simple, actionable insights  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, I will also try to **deploy it as a small web app**, so users can interact with it instead of only reading the notebook.  \n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Plan (Steps I will follow)  \n",
    "1. **Collect/Generate Data** â€“ I will simulate a dataset that looks like personal finance records (income, expenses, savings, categories, dates).  \n",
    "2. **Clean the Data** â€“ Handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.  \n",
    "3. **Explore the Data** â€“ Perform analysis & visualization to see patterns.  \n",
    "4. **Model Building** â€“  \n",
    "   - Regression: Predict future savings  \n",
    "   - Classification: Detect overspending  \n",
    "5. **Evaluation** â€“ Test how well the models perform.  \n",
    "6. **Deployment** â€“ Build a small interactive web app (probably using *Streamlit*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Environment Check  \n",
    "Before starting, I want to confirm that my environment is ready.  \n",
    "This ensures that anyone running this notebook knows which versions of Python and the main libraries I used.\n"
